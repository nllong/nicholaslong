I have always enjoyed learning. I went to school for Electrical Engineering and Architectural Engineering. I am a current PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Architectural Engineering program. I also work at a National Lab developing software solutions for saving energy in commercial buildings. 

Check out my LinkedIn page to see more about my vocation.

I enjoy hanging with the family, playing the bass guitar, running, and working on anything mechnical.
