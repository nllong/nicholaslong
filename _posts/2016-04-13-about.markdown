I have always enjoyed learning. I went to school for Electrical Engineering and Architectural Engineering. I have a PhD and Masters from the University of Colorado Boulder in the Architectural Engineering (building sciences). I also work at a National Lab developing software solutions for saving energy in commercial buildings. 

Check out my LinkedIn page to see more about my vocation.

I enjoy hanging with the family, rock climbing, playing the bass guitar and piano, yoga, running, and working on anything mechanical.
